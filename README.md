# QuantumComputerSimulator
This is  quantum computer simulator that I developed using python and you can use this to simulate quantum computers behavior.
This simulator is created using the points mentioned in this article of qosf mentorship task : https://github.com/quantastica/qosf-mentorship/blob/master/qosf-simulator-task.ipynb
I encourage you to read the How_to_use_MyQuantumSimulator.ipynb file to learn to use this quantum computer simulator, I have tried to make it simple to use. You can also explore the source code present in th file MyQuantumSimulator.py. 
Feels free to drop comments or suggestions. Thank you!
