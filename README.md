# QuantumComputerSimulator
This is  quantum computer simulator that I developed using python and you can use this to simulate quantum computers behavior.
This simulator is created using the points mentioned in this article of qosf mentorship task : https://github.com/quantastica/qosf-mentorship/blob/master/qosf-simulator-task.ipynb
I encourage you to read the How_to_use_MyQuantumSimulator.ipynb file to learn to use this quantum computer simulator, I have tried to make it simple to use. You can also explore the source code present in th file MyQuantumSimulator.py. 
Feels free to drop comments or suggestions.
You can also check out the implementation of grover's algorithm using my simulator in the file Grover's_algorithm_2qubits.ipynb .
Thank you!
